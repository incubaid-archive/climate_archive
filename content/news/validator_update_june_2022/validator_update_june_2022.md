ðŸš¨ **ThreeFold Validator Nodes Update!**

<br/>

This week, we shared an update on our validator programs. **Give [this post](https://forum.threefold.io/t/validator-update/3049) a read** to learn more about the **engineering and deployment status** of the L2 and L0 validators. The update also includes a new set of FAQs, e.g. on rewards and hardware requirements.
