Hi all â€“

<br/>

There is a new Grid Enhancement Proposal live [on the forum](https://forum.threefold.io/t/pricing-default-40-discount/2924) focused on default discount level on the grid. For context, please also see [this forum post](https://forum.threefold.io/t/pricing-competitiveness-tf-vs-aws-and-others/2674/10) about pricing.

<br/>

Please take a look and vote after you have an understanding of the topic. If you have any questions, please ask on the forum topic and we will clarify.

Thank you for your participation!
